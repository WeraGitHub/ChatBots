# Chatbot Projects

Welcome to the Chatbot Projects repository! This collection features four conversational chatbots created using various natural language processing techniques and tools in Python.

## Introduction

In this repository, you'll find a set of conversational chatbots developed using different natural language processing (NLP) techniques. Each chatbot has a unique implementation, with some of them utilizing NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit) with techniques such as Bag of Words (BOW), TF-IDF, and cosine similarity. And two chatbots are built using pre-trained models.
